LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) based RNN(Recurrent Neural Network) model to predict stock price with dataset extractor for nepali stock prices. 


*It is impossible to accurately predict stock prices. This model gives predictions based upon the previous trend and may serve as a tool for you to make educated decision, to some degree better than random choice.Therefore, Do not base your decision entirely from the prediction made by this model.*

#### Overview

* see ipython demo file, demo.ipynb for the demo
*  ***dataExtractor.py*** extracts required share price data of a company from sharesansar.com neccessary to train the model




#### Dependencies:
* Keras
* Tensorflow
* Scikit-learn
