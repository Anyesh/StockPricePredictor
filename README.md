LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) based RNN(Recurrent Neural Network) model to predict stock price with dataset extractor for nepali stock prices. 

It is impossible to accurately predict stock prices. This model gives predictions based upon the previous trend and may serve as a tool for you to make educated decision. 

*Do not base your decision entirely from the prediction made by this model. However, in most instances, this model should surely outperform stock predictions made by a monkey.*
